# predicting_blood_donation_with_logistic_regression
This is a Driven Data (www.drivendata.org) project to predict blood donation with Logistic regression. 
It is my first personal and complete project as a data scientist. 

The code can be found in the "predict_blood.ipynb" file. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis
First I did some exploratory data analysis to the project to better understand the data

## Feature engineering
I did some feature engineering by creating new features to the exisiting features 
in order to maximize the information in the data to build an accurate model as much as possible

## Using logistic regression
I used logistic regression to build my predicitve model.
